    Compositional surface (Issue #284, byte-grounded in the user's real rules + capture
    program "0624"). ``ports`` is a list of 1-based port numbers governed by this single
    rule; the grouptDevType bitmask is ``sum(2**(p-1) for p in ports)``.

    ``mode`` is the single mode pick: ``off``, ``on``, ``cycle``, ``auto`` or ``vpd``. The
    wire integer for each is resolved from ``controller_type`` — the two controller classes
    number these differently and invert on/off, so there is no single correct set of
    literals to quote here. See the table in ``controller.py`` (#326, #328). Auto and VPD
    additionally take a ``control_style``:
    ``target`` (settingMode=1) or ``trigger`` (settingMode=0).

    Speed range: ``max_level`` → ``onSpeed``, ``min_level`` → ``offSpeed``. (``on_speed``
    is a legacy alias for the On-mode max; when given and ``max_level`` is its default it
    sets onSpeed directly to preserve the original create byte-identity.)

    Sensor targets/triggers are explicitly assigned per field; inactive families are parked
    at their rail (°C parked at rail, NOT derived). Buffer → ``*Buff``, transition →
    ``*Trans`` (the two are mutually exclusive per sensor — validated upstream). ``switch_time``
    bits 0–6 = days (bit0=Mon … bit6=Sun), bit 7 = continuous.

    A *program* is a shared ``(groupNums, sortType)`` slot whose rules carry sequential
    ``subNumber``. ``addGroups`` is gated by ``is_flag`` (Issue #284, iOS-app capture):
    ``is_flag=1`` → NEW program (server assigns a fresh slot, ``subNumber=0`` — sent
    ``group_nums``/``sort_type`` are ignored); ``is_flag=0`` → APPEND (server HONORS the
    sent ``group_nums`` + ``sort_type`` = the target program's slot, and
    ``subNumber``/``subNumberSort`` = existing max + 1, so the rule joins that program).
    The defaults (``is_flag=1``, no slot, ``sub_number=0``) reproduce the original
    new-program output byte-for-byte.

        The API encodes port data as bitmask integers rather than a ports array:
        - ``portSpead``: 4 bits (one nibble) per port, LSB = Port 1.
          Values 0-10 are fan/dimmer speeds; 0xF (15) means ON for
          on/off devices (lights, heaters, humidifiers, heat pads).
        - ``portStatus``: 1 bit per port, LSB = Port 1.  Indicates
          whether the port was actively triggered by automation.

        Args:
            record: Raw historical record from get_historical_data API call
            port_names: Optional mapping of port number -> name from live
                device info.  When provided the names are attached to
                each decoded port entry.

        Returns:
