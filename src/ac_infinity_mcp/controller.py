"""Controller-type detection and write payload building.

Implements the read-before-write pattern for both legacy and AI+ controllers.
Both devType 11/18 (legacy) and devType 22 (AI+) use the same 142-field response
structure from getdevModeSettingList. The write payload is the flat scalar subset
with modeSetid stripped (Quirk 11) and modeType enforced (Quirk 12).

    Legacy: devType in {11, 18} or newFrameworkDevice == False
    New framework: devType >= 20 or newFrameworkDevice == True

    A numeric string ("20") is coerced and classified normally. An **absent**
    devType still resolves to LEGACY via the ``0`` default — long-standing
    behaviour, and what main's own ``_ctype`` does for a device that is missing
    entirely. A devType that is *present but unreadable* raises
    ``ACInfinityDeviceError``.

    Raising rather than guessing is deliberate, and the reason is narrow and
    specific. This function no longer only picks a payload shape: since #348 it
    also selects the Groups ``currentMode`` table, and the two tables collide on
    the wire — LEGACY ``off`` is 2, NEW_FRAMEWORK ``on`` is 2. Guessing LEGACY
    for an AI+ whose devType did not parse would therefore encode a requested
    *off* as a 2 that the hardware reads as *on*. That is #326 exactly: the
    issue whose title is that ``mode="off"`` energized a grow light.

    A wrong guess here energizes equipment; a raise is caught by the server
    layer's existing handler and reaches the grower as a readable error. The
    second reason the old ``TypeError`` was unacceptable still holds — it
    escaped unhandled from gates sitting outside their tool's try/except — but
    that is fixed by the exception being *typed*, not by returning a value.

    Bools are rejected even though ``bool`` is an ``int`` subclass: ``True``
    would otherwise coerce to devType 1 and classify LEGACY silently.

    Raises:
        ACInfinityDeviceError: devType is present but cannot be read as an int.
