# Shared by analytics.py (history interpretation) and client.py (write guard).
# Kept here so neither of those has to import the other.
# AC Infinity loadType values for toggle (on/off) hardware — heaters, lights,
# humidifiers. Two behaviours key off this set: such devices always emit speed=1
# in the history API even when physically OFF, and they reject variable-speed
# writes with code 999999 (see client._set_port_mode_inner).
#
# The two sets are split by where the evidence was gathered, and the split is
# deliberate: an earlier revision of this PR widened the shared set to all four
# values, which silently changed get_port_activity_report and Rule D ghost
# filtering on LEGACY hardware from a PR about an AI+ request header. 129 and
# 132 have only ever been observed on devType 20/22, so only the new-framework
# write guard consults them.
#
#   4, 128  — devType 11 (C58ZA). Attested on legacy; the historical set.
#   129     — devType 22 (Q0KT4) ports 2/3/5: clone lights, rack lights, heat pad
#   132     — devType 22 (Q0KT4) port 1: clone heat pad; devType 20 toggle ports
#
# Deliberately a membership set, not a bitmask. 132 == 128|4 invites
# `load_type & (4|128)`, but that would newly catch 5, 6, 12, 136, 260... on a
# field Quirk 24 already calls unreliable for devType 18/22. Membership fails
# safe toward letting a write through; a mask fails toward permanently refusing
# a genuinely variable-speed port, which is unfalsifiable from the write path.
